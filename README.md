**Spotizer** (Spotify + Deezer) is a GUI tool designed to help download Spotify tracks from Deezer by matching **ISRC** *(International Standard Recording Code),* which is highly accurate. You can get an ARL for free by pressing `Get ARL` or by entering your own ARL. Just use a free Deezer account, and that's enough.
