<b>Spotizer</b> (Spotify + Deezer) is a GUI tool designed to help download Spotify tracks, albums, and playlists from Deezer by matching <b>ISRC</b> <i>(International Standard Recording Code),</i> which is highly accurate. You can get an ARL for free by pressing <code>Get ARL</code> or by entering your own ARL. Just use a free Deezer account, and that's enough.
